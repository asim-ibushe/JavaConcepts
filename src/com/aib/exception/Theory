If an exception occurs, then the rest of the commands/statements are not executed in the program

We can handle the exception by using keywords such as 'try', 'catch', 'finally', 'throw' and 'throws'

There are two kinds of exception - unchecked and checked exception
but one should remember that all exception occur at run time only.

Checked Exception - The exception which are handled at compile time e.g. I/OException, JsonProcessingException, SQLException etc. 

Unchecked Exception - The exception which are not handled at compile time e.g. NullPointer Exception, ArithMatic Exception, 
IndexOutOfBoundException etc to name a few.
